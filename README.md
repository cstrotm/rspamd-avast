## Description

[avast.lua](https://github.com/rseichter/rspamd-avast) is a [Rspamd](https://www.rspamd.com/) antivirus extension
module for the [Avast](https://www.avast.com/de-de/index#mac) virus scanner, written in [Lua](https://www.lua.org).
The module was tested with Rspamd 2.2 and Avast 3.0.3.

## Prerequisites

avast.lua requires [lua-socket](http://w3.impa.br/~diego/software/luasocket/home.html) version 3, which is expected
to be found in `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/lua/5.1/`. For Debian 10 you can use `apt install lua-socket` to install
the necessary package.

As of January 2020, Avast only supports UNIX Domain Sockets, so the virus scanner must run on the same machine
as Rspamd. Please ensure that the domain socket allows R/W access for the Rspamd process and that you set the
socket path in your `antivirus.conf` (the default value is `/run/avast/scan.sock`). The `tmpdir` parameter defaults
to the value of the TMPDIR environment variable (if available) or `/tmp`.

## Installation

*  Place a copy of `avast.lua` in your `/usr/share/rspamd/lualib/lua_scanners` directory.
*  Add the line `require_scanner('avast')` to `lua_scanners/init.lua`.
*  Add a section to your `local.d/antivirus.conf`:
```
avast {
  type = 'avast';
  # Avast socket path
  #socket = '/run/avast/scan.sock';
  # Message content is temporarily stored in this directory
  #tmpdir = '/tmp';
  # Log clean files as well
  #log_clean = false;
  # Force this action if any virus is found (default: unset)
  action = 'reject';
}
```
*  Restart Rspamd.
